## üìä Overview
This repository presents a modification of the [Differential Convolution]([Completed]_Differential_Convolution.ipynb) technique, reducing the feature maps from the original five to four. This modification aims to explore the effects of [feature map](Diffconv-4-5-6-Maps.ipynb) reduction on model performance and efficiency.

## üìà [Performance Comparison](Testing-Diffconv-4-5-and-6-[COMPLETE].ipynb)
- **Without Modification**: 80.33%
- **With Modification (4 Feature Maps)**: 85.47%
- **Original (5 Feature Maps)**: 85.58%
- **Isselmou (6 Feature Maps)**: 85.62%

## üîç Results
The modified Differential Convolution, using 4 feature maps, demonstrates competitive performance with an accuracy of 85.47%, closely approaching that of the original and Isselmou's versions. This suggests that reducing feature maps can maintain high performance while potentially offering gains in efficiency.

## üí° Key Insights
- The modification showcases the possibility of achieving competitive perfromance with less computational demands
- This approach's primary focus is efficiency.
