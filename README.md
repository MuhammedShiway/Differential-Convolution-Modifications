# Differential Convolution Modification

## 📊 Overview
This repository presents a modification of the Differential Convolution technique, reducing the feature maps from the original five to four. This modification aims to explore the effects of feature map reduction on model performance and efficiency.

## 📈 Performance Comparison
- **Without Modification**: 80.33%
- **With Modification (4 Feature Maps)**: 85.47%
- **Original (5 Feature Maps)**: 85.58%
- **Isselmou (6 Feature Maps)**: 85.62%

## 🔍 Results
The modified Differential Convolution, using 4 feature maps, demonstrates competitive performance with an accuracy of 85.47%, closely approaching that of the original and Isselmou's versions. This suggests that reducing feature maps can maintain high performance while potentially offering gains in efficiency.

## 💡 Key Insights
- The modification showcases the possibility of achieving competitive perfromance with less computational demands
- This approach's primary focus is efficiency.
